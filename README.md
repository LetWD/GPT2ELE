## ü§ñ How to Ask ChatGPT for Compatible Output

To get output that's compatible with `G2E.py`, use this prompt:

```
Create an Electron app with the following structure:

- A folder name at the top
- Full content of these files:
  [package.json]
  (Include basic Electron config with "start": "electron .")

  [index.html]
  (Simple HTML with a button and <script src="renderer.js">)

  [main.js]
  (Create a BrowserWindow and load index.html)

  [renderer.js]
  (Attach event to the button, e.g., alert)

Format it like this:

FolderName  
[package.json]  
...  
[index.html]  
...  
[main.js]  
...  
[renderer.js]  
...

The goal is to copy and paste the whole thing into a Python script that creates files automatically.
```

This format allows `G2E.py` to:

* Detect the folder name
* Extract each file block
* Create the Electron project automatically
* Run `npm install` and prepare to launch
